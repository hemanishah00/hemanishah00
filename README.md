Hey I am Hemani,

I like to work on interesting AI, data analytics and machine learning problems. I aim to use my knowledge about data to solve real-world problems.

I recently graduated as a Computer Engineer (9.02/10 CGPA, Batch of 2022) from Gujarat Technological University. At Univ.ai, I am a student in the Master Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning program. I am also working as a TA for Univ.ai. Debugging code and explaining complex ML concepts in the simplest way possible has helped me hone up my skills.

I grew up in a coastal City named Valsad Gujarat in West India.

I am curious, technical minded and hardworking. Tieing different fields together fascinates me. I believe data should be an art form. I can make it interesting.I can be found learning something new whenever I get a chance.

You can best reach me via email. I am always looking forward to opportunities to learn something new, collaborations and meeting new people.

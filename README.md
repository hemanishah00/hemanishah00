Hey I am Hemani,

I like to work on interesting AI, data analysis and machine learning problems. My aim is to use modern computing power and the vast amount of data available to solve real-world problems.

Primarily I am a final year Computer Engineering student, studying at Gujarat Technological University. I am also enrolled in Masters in AI and ML program at Univ.ai

I grew up in a coastal City named Valsad Gujarat in West India. My pronouns are she/her.

I am curious, technical minded and hardworking. Tieing different fields together fascinates me. I believe data should be an art form. I can make it interesting.I can be found learning something new whenever I get a chance.

You can best reach me via email. I am always looking forward to new opportunities, collaborations and meeting new people.
